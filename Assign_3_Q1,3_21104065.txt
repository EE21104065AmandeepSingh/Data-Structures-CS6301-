Ans 1 :
In-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for 
manipulating the input but may require a small though non-constant 
extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though 
sometimes anything in O(n) (Smaller than linear) is allowed.

Examples of in place Sorting Algorithms:-
-Bubble Sort
-Heap Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Quick Sort
-Selection sort

Examples of not in place Algorithms :-
-Merge Sort
-Radix Sort

Ans 3 :
Some real life example of Inplace are:
1. In windows explorer when we sort the files according to date or size or time
2. When we change the order of pages in a PDF 
3. When we change the order of slides in a presentation

Some real life examples of out place:
 a. The function which runs on call by value uses a copy of the parameter to do 
 b. its processing and then return that copy.
